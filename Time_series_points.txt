1.An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms-p,d,q
 p is the order of the AR(AUTOREGRESSIVE) Term
 q is the order of the Moving Average term
 d is the number of differencing required to make a series statioary.

2) In case we have a sesonal component in a time series,we call it SARIMA

3)AR(Autoregressive) in ARIMA means it is a linear regression model,that uses its own 
lagged values as predictors.

So if the DV(Yt),then the IDV is (value of the DV at the previous time periods,i.e
Yt-1,Yt-2,Yt-3...and so on..

so if our metric(DV)  is 'sales' then sales in a current period (t) will depend on the
sales in the period(t-1),(t-2),(t-3) and so on.

4) The Moving average (MA) model also is a linear regression model,where the DV(Yt)
is dependent on the IDV(Et,Et-1,Et-2...and so on) which is the preciction error E() at
the current time period(Et) and its lagged values (Et-1,Et-2,Et-3....and so on)

5) Both the AR and MA models are linear regression models,but we do not get a staright
line as,we have fluctuautions in our plot due to trend,sesasonality,variance, noise
elements.

6) AR=p, MA= q (p,q=lags we want) D = differencing order. This differencing is done
to make the series stationary. If we have more fluctuations,more differencing is 
needed. 
A stationary series will be more even,with minimum fluctuations.

7)How do we understand a series is Stationary?

ans--- A stationary series will have no trend. it will look like a scatterplot
which shows no movement in a particular direction.
When we get such a series,with no trend,we call it stationary.
acheiving stationarity is THE MAIN ASSUMPTION IN TIME SERIES FORECASTING.


8) So to sum it up,when we are forecasting sales,WE WILL START WITH THE ASSUMPTION 
THAT THE CURRENT PERIOD SALES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SALES OF THE PREVIOUS PERIOD/PERIODS.
